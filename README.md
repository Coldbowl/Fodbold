## Thinkaloud user test

One participant who volunteered said "Det' fint".

## Nielsen's 10 heureistics and future improvements in my program

### 1. Visibility of System Status

Everything is visible in one neat screen.


## 2. Match Between the System and the Real World

No trace of officialese is used. This *(sort of)* implies the user understands the error messages or general notifications that pops up


### 3. User Control and Freedom

In this section, there is a clear room for improvement. As of right now, there is no way to undo a payment, since it is fairly simple. You provide a name and enter the amount you want to log. While it is true this process can still be screwed up, no thought was given at the time of writing the program


### 4. Consistency and Standards

The *simple* GUI is made in Tkinter, which doesn't leave a lot of intuitive room for design choices. If this were to be improved upon, or if the GUI simply **was not made in Tkinter**, this issue wouldn't be present.


### 5. Error Prevention

It is not possible to *crash* the program or mismatch datatypes of any sort. Slips are entirely possible, and is covered in **Point 3: User Control and Freedom**


### 6. Recognition Rather than Recall

This point is achieved by having everything on one screen. The only thing not visible or obvious at first, is the fact that the header contains the option to completely reset the progress of payment


### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

This point isn't relevant for such a small and simple project, but if it were to be expanded upon, it might be found relevant


### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

I believe I have made my point numerous times


### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

Error messages are clear visually and even auditorily, since it pops up as any other Windows notification/error


### 10. Help and Documentation

No help to be found, haha. Good luck!
